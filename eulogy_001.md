# David Johnson

It isn't up to us to choose what challenges are assigned to us in this life.
That decision is up to God.
We can only choose how we respond to each challenge.

No one who knew him would claim David had an easy life.
But on the far side of every difficulty, no matter how onerous, David would always get back up and try again.
His tenacity is one of the many qualities we want to remember David for today.*
Perhaps the hardest aspect remembering him today is that (after decades of these obstacles) David's early death comes at a point in his life when he was beginning to see more sun than clouds.

[ ...at a point when his life was the most hopeful. ]

Alvena had David in 1981, just two days before her sister gave birth to David's cousin Steven.
The two boys were often together in their early years.
When they were, Irene was often tempted to dress them in identical clothing.
In 1983, when David was two, Alvena left him with his aunt Irene for a sleepover.
Irene gave the two boys matching outfits and took them out grocery shopping.
Approaching the checkout counter, a smiling Ukrainian woman exclaimed "Oh, how adorable!" then proceded to ask: "Are they twins?"

David was a memorable two-year-old.
At two, David did not walk.
He ran.
He jumped.
He skipped.
But he did not walk.
It was David's inexhaustable energy that so many people throughout his life would know him for.

It was also about at this age that David grew into his unmistakable laugh.
David always had an exuberant laugh.
Frequently disarming when he was small, he would sometimes sneak up on his cousins and surprise them with ... a laugh.
Suddenly aware of David's presence, the surprised cousin would turn around with eyes wide open, to see him grinning back with his equally unmistakable smile.

In the same way that Alvena's door is always open to anyone, David's warmth and smile were always the beginning of every new friendship he made.
Before David joined Kindergarten, Alvena would take him across the continent in the cab of her semi truck.
This marked the beginning of David and Alvena as a team -- not just family, but partners.
It also marked the beginning of David's tendency to make friends with anyone and everyone.
Once, while stopped for fuel on the way to Los Angeles, David was approached by one of the other truckers, who later recounted this story to Alvena.
"What's your name, little man?" asked the trucker.
"My name's David. What's yours?"
"My name's Robert."
"Well, Robert," repied David, "my Mom says I'm actually not supposed to talk to strangers."
He thought for a second and then added: "But now that I know your name, we're not strangers anymore."

[ TODO: look up A&D Systems -- 2004? ]

This partnership of Alvena and David's didn't achieve an official status until the incorporation of A&D Systems in 2004.
However, everyone already saw the two of them this way by the 1980s.
This was the decade Alvena would pull up to houses of friends and family as she travelled the country in her red Toyota Celica.
She and David would spill out of the car with the latest gadgets, technology, and toys: the first IBM portable computer (with video games!) and a large bin of Space Lego.
The Space Lego was iconic in to ways:

First, it was a synecdoche for the extraordinary and futuristic life the two of them lived together.
David's life in those years was an adventure.
Second, the surreal spaceships and landscapes David would create hinted at the art he would create in his teenaged years.

[ TODO: do we bother mentioning the grand theft auto? :p ]

In his early teens, David would paint and draw -- often digitally.
At this age he also began listening to rap and hip-hop, which encouraged him to explore lyrics and poetry for himself.
Few of us in this room have heard David perform his poetry.
Those of you who have already know how fortunate you are.

[ TODO: if Alvena finds a poem(s), one could go here. ]

Toward the end of his highschool career, David fell in love with two sports: wrestling and football.
Wrestling attracted him directly but football required encouragement.
Gene Scott, who would become his coach, brought him to football with the words: "You. I want YOU on the football team."
[ Many of the difficulties David faced in high school were balanced by the strength and success he found in sports. ]

Over the years, David acquired many skills in the trades.
He apprenticed in welding at Advanced Engineering.
He learned masonry and carpentry -- and found jobs in both.
Most recently, he achieved his full certification in roofing.
David found deep satisfaction in the completion of a job -- and it was often the most difficult jobs he enjoyed the most.
His Facebook feed is peppered with photos of his broad smile at his most recent job site.
