# David Johnson

It isn't up to us to choose what challenges are assigned to us in this life.
That decision is up to God.
We can only choose how we respond to each challenge.

No one would claim David had an easy life.
But on the far side of every difficulty, no matter how onerous, David would always get back up and try again.
His tenacity is one of the many qualities we want to remember David for today.*
Perhaps the hardest aspect of today is that (after decades of these obstacles) David's early death comes at a point in his life when he was beginning to see more sun than clouds.

[ ...at a point when his life was the most hopeful. ]

Alvena had David in 1981, just two days before her sister gave birth to David's cousin Steven.
The two boys were often together in their early years.
When they were, Irene was often tempted to dress them in identical clothing.
In 1983, when David was two, Alvena left him with his aunt Irene for a sleepover.
Irene gave the two boys matching outfits and took them out grocery shopping.
Approaching the checkout counter, a smiling Ukrainian woman exclaimed "Oh, how adorable!" then proceded to ask: "Are they twins?"

David was a memorable two-year-old.
At two, David did not walk.
He ran.
He jumped.
He skipped.
But he did not walk.
It was David's inexhaustable energy that so many people throughout his life would know him for.

It was also about at this age that David grew into his unmistakable laugh.
David always had an exuberant laugh.
Frequently disarming when he was small, he would sometimes sneak up on his cousins and surprise them with ... a laugh.
Suddenly aware of David's presence, the surprised cousin would turn around with eyes wide open, to see him grinning back with his equally unmistakable smile.

In the same way that Alvena's door is always open to anyone, David's warmth and smile were always the beginning of every new friendship he made.
Before David joined Kindergarten, Alvena would take him across the continent in the cab of her semi truck.
This marked the beginning of David and Alvena as a team -- not just family, but partners.
It also marked the beginning of David's tendency to make friends with anyone and everyone.
Once, while stopped for fuel on the way to Los Angeles, David was approached by one of the other truckers, who later recounted this story to Alvena.
"What's your name, little man?" asked the trucker.
"My name's David. What's yours?"
"My name's Robert."
"Well, Robert," repied David, "my Mom says I'm actually not supposed to talk to strangers."
He thought for a second and then added: "But now that I know your name, we're not strangers anymore."
