# David Johnson

It isn't up to us to choose what challenges are assigned to us in this life.
That decision is up to God.
We can only choose how we respond to each challenge.

No one would claim David had an easy life.
But on the far side of every difficulty, no matter how onerous, David would always get back up and try again.
Tenacity is one of the many qualities we want to remember David for today.*
Perhaps the hardest aspect of today is that (after decades of these obstacles) David's early death comes at a point in his life when he was beginning to see more sun than clouds.
