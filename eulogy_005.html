<h1>David Johnson</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>It isn't up to us to choose what challenges are assigned to us in this life.
That decision is up to God.
We can only choose how we respond to each challenge.</p>
<p>No one who knew him would claim David had an easy life.
But on the far side of every difficulty, no matter how onerous, David would always get back up and try again.
His tenacity is one of the many qualities we remember David for today.</p>
<p>Perhaps the hardest aspect of remembering him today is that (after decades of these obstacles) David's early death comes at a point in his life when he was beginning to see more sun than clouds.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Early Years</h2>
<p>David was born to Alvena and Paul on July 28th, 1981.
Two days later, Alvena's sister Irene gave David a cousin ...me.
The two of us were often together in our early years.
Based on photos, we were apparently quite the pudgy pair of two-year-olds.</p>
<p>It's also apparent from photos that, when we were together, our Moms were often tempted to dress us in identical clothing.
On one such occasion, the two of us -- in matching outfits -- went on a shopping trip to a grocery store in Yorkton.
As we pudgeballs approached the checkout counter, a smiling old Ukranian woman exclaimed &quot;Oh, how adorable!&quot; then proceeded to ask: &quot;Are they twins?&quot;</p>
<hr>
<h2>Energy</h2>
<p>David was unforgettable as a two-year-old.
At two, David did not walk.
He ran.
He jumped.
He skipped.
But he did not walk.
It was David's inexhaustible energy that so many people throughout his life would recognize him for.</p>
<p>When he was 5, David stayed with his cousins in the McLaren family while Alvena was taking a robotics course in Moose Jaw.
Auntie Julie recounts David pouring enthusiasm, exuberance, and energy into absolutely everything he did.
Except for skating.
According to Julie: &quot;Skating... he did not like.&quot;
Skating was perhaps akin to slow walking for young David.</p>
<p>So energetic was David in the McLaren household that when uncle Hugh would come home from work and bend down to hug all the kids, David's hug arrived at sufficient velocity to knock Hugh on his butt.
Those who witnessed this -- and remember Hugh's laugh upon being bowled over -- might find comfort in knowing that now David is with Hugh again, who loved him so unconditionally.</p>
<p>David's energy remained spirited througout his life.
As we all grew older, visits with extended family found gaps measured in years instead of months.
But no matter how long it had been, David's joy and energy were the first things you would notice when he stepped out of a car to say hello to any family.
As our cousin Lindsay recalled: &quot;Every single time I have seen him, he was <em>always</em> excited to see me.&quot;
When you were around David, at any age, it was surprisingly easy to <em>feel loved.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>Laughing, Smiling, Teasing</h2>
<p>A crucial input to that feeling was born in David's early childhood: his unmistakable, lifelong laugh.
Frequently disarming even when he was small, he would sometimes sneak up on his cousins and surprise them with ... his signature laugh.
Suddenly aware of David's presence, the surprised cousin would turn around, eyes wide open, only to see him grinning back with his equally unmistakable smile.</p>
<p>Our cousin Mark recently combed through videos Uncle Don had taken at Grandma Markland's 75th birthday.
In them, David is goofing around in the back yard, teasing cousins, aunts and uncles, and -- most of all -- his Mom.
Alvena steps into the frame as David jokes with his aunts about <em>just exactly how many buttons</em> does <em>his shirt have, anyway?</em>, while they all laugh behind the camera.
David puts his arm around Alvena ... and then proceeds to lean on her with more and more weight until she protests, &quot;Daaavid! You're heavy!&quot;
The smiles on their two faces during this exchange speak volumes about the tenderness and affection of their relationship.</p>
<p>David is 18 in these videos.
Young, but already halfway through his story.
Still, his smile was the same at 18, as it was when he was a Preschooler, as it was last year.</p>
<p>In the same way that Alvena's door is always open to anyone, David's warmth and smile were always the beginning of every new friendship he made.</p>
<p>Before David joined Kindergarten, Alvena would take him across the continent in the cab of her semi truck.
This marked the beginning of David and Alvena as a team -- not just family, but partners.
It also marked the beginning of David's tendency to make friends with anyone and everyone.</p>
<p>Once, while stopped for fuel on the way to California, David was approached by one of the other truckers, who later recounted this story to Alvena.</p>
<p>&quot;What's your name, little man?&quot; asked the trucker.</p>
<p>&quot;My name's David. What's yours?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My name's Peter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Peter,&quot; replied David, &quot;my Mom says I'm actually not supposed to talk to strangers.&quot;
He thought about that for a second and then added: &quot;But now that I know your name, we're not strangers anymore.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<h2>The A&amp;D System</h2>
<p>This partnership of Alvena and David's didn't achieve brand status until the incorporation of the eponymous A&amp;D Systems in the early 2000s.
However, everyone already thought of the two of them as a team by the 1980s.
This was the decade Alvena would pull up to houses of friends and family as she travelled the country in her red Toyota Celica.
She and David would spill out of the sports car with the latest gadgets, technology, and toys: the first IBM portable computer (with video games!) and a large bin of Space Lego.
That Space Lego was iconic in two ways:</p>
<p>First, it was a synecdoche for the extraordinary and futuristic life the two of them lived together.
Alvena was a &quot;digital nomad&quot; decades before that term was ever coined.
David's life in those years was an <em>adventure.</em></p>
<p>Second, the surreal spaceships and landscapes David built hinted at the art he would create in his teenaged years.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Art &amp; Music</h2>
<p>In his teens and twenties, David would paint and draw -- often digitally.
On the back of your program you will find one of David's original digital prints from this time.</p>
<p>At this age he also began listening to more rap and hip-hop.
This encouraged him to explore lyrics and poetry for himself, though he was perhaps more private about this aspect of his life than any other.
Few of us in this room have heard David perform his written poetry.
Those of you who have, already know how fortunate you are.
David's signature lyrical style involved stream-of-consciousness transitions and intentionally did not include any hooks -- a method of thematic storytelling that's difficult to master.</p>
<p>Later in life, David discovered another outlet for his love of music: hymns.
It may be difficult for some of us to imagine, but Pastor Rapley warmly remembers David clapping and nodding to the vibrant music of the church.</p>
<p>Though not <em>terribly</em> fond of yielding to authority, David found something larger than himself in faith, and was always respectful of the church.
Pastor Rapley assures us that, on the rare occasions when David had a slip of the tongue, he was always quick to follow with <em>&quot;sorry father&quot;.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>Sports</h2>
<p>Toward the end of his highschool career, David fell in love with two sports: wrestling and football.
Wrestling attracted him directly -- but football required encouragement.</p>
<p>Gene Scott, who would eventually become his coach, invited him to football with the words: &quot;You. I want YOU on the football team.&quot;
Good fortune and compassionate guidance helped bring David to the sport he most excelled at.</p>
<p>The strength, success, and friendships he found in sports brought structure and balance to his highschool career.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Friends</h2>
<p>When his cousins attended university in Regina, David selflessly introduced them to the many friends he made at Robert Usher high school.</p>
<p>David saw the world differently.
As a result, David was always generous with his time, money, and friendships in a way that many of us struggle to achieve.</p>
<p>Over the following years, David acquired many more skills and friends in the trades.
He apprenticed in welding at Advanced Engineering.
He learned masonry and carpentry.
Most recently, he achieved his full certification in roofing.
David found deep satisfaction in the completion of a job.
And it was often the most difficult jobs that he took the most pride in.
His Facebook feed is peppered with photos of his broad smile at the site of each project.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Goodbye</h2>
<p>From childhood, to high school, to his working life, David was well-known -- and well-liked.
He made these connections thanks to the qualities we remember today:</p>
<ul>
<li>his energy, smile, and humour</li>
<li>his warmth and ease in friendship</li>
<li>his love of music, art, and sports</li>
<li>his faith</li>
<li>but most significantly, his generosity</li>
</ul>
<p>When David had money, he would share it with you.
When David had time, he would spend it with you.
And, under the hardest circumstances, if all David had was his smile and his laugh, he would give you those.
That was the tenacity of David's generosity.</p>
<p>We will be enriched by remembering David's generosity throughout our own lives.
And, in that memory, may we strive to see and treat others in the same way.</p>
