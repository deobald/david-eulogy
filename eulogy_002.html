<h1>David Johnson</h1>
<p>It isn't up to us to choose what challenges are assigned to us in this life.
That decision is up to God.
We can only choose how we respond to each challenge.</p>
<p>No one who knew him would claim David had an easy life.
But on the far side of every difficulty, no matter how onerous, David would always get back up and try again.
His tenacity is one of the many qualities we remember David for today.
Perhaps the hardest aspect remembering him today is that (after decades of these obstacles) David's early death comes at a point in his life when he was beginning to see more sun than clouds.</p>
<p>David was born to Alvena and Paul on July 28th, 1981.
Two days later, Alvena's sister Irene gave David a cousin.
The two boys were often together in their early years.
Quite the pudgy pair they were: one a brown curly top and one a pale blonde.
Both round.</p>
<p>When they were together, the sisters were often tempted to dress the two boys in identical clothing.
On one such occasion, the two-year-old cousins -- in matching outfits -- went on a shopping trip to a grocery store in Yorkton.
Approaching the checkout counter, a smiling old Ukranian woman exclaimed &quot;Oh, how adorable!&quot; then proceded to ask: &quot;Are they twins?&quot;</p>
<p>David was unforgettable as a two-year-old.
At two, David did not walk.
He ran.
He jumped.
He skipped.
But he did not walk.
It was David's inexhaustable energy that so many people throughout his life would recognize him for.</p>
<p>It was also about at this age that David grew into his unmistakable, lifelong laugh.
Frequently disarming even when he was small, he would sometimes sneak up on his cousins and surprise them with ... his signature laugh.
Suddenly aware of David's presence, the surprised cousin would turn around with eyes wide open, only to see him grinning back with his equally unmistakable smile.</p>
<p>In the same way that Alvena's door is always open to anyone, David's warmth and smile were always the beginning of every new friendship he made.
Before David joined Kindergarten, Alvena would take him across the continent in the cab of her semi truck.
This marked the beginning of David and Alvena as a team -- not just family, but partners.
It also marked the beginning of David's tendency to make friends with anyone and everyone.
Once, while stopped for fuel on the way to Los Angeles, David was approached by one of the other truckers, who later recounted this story to Alvena.
&quot;What's your name, little man?&quot; asked the trucker.
&quot;My name's David. What's yours?&quot;
&quot;My name's Robert.&quot;
&quot;Well, Robert,&quot; repied David, &quot;my Mom says I'm actually not supposed to talk to strangers.&quot;
He thought for a second and then added: &quot;But now that I know your name, we're not strangers anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>This partnership of Alvena and David's didn't achieve an official status until the incorporation of A&amp;D Systems in the early 2000s.
However, everyone already thought of the two of them as a team by the 1980s.
This was the decade Alvena would pull up to houses of friends and family as she travelled the country in her red Toyota Celica.
She and David would spill out of the car with the latest gadgets, technology, and toys: the first IBM portable computer (with video games!) and a large bin of Space Lego.
The Space Lego was iconic in two ways:</p>
<p>First, it was a synecdoche for the extraordinary and futuristic life the two of them lived together.
David's life in those years was an adventure.
Second, the surreal spaceships and landscapes David built hinted at the art he would create in his teenaged years.</p>
<p>In his teens and twenties, David would paint and draw -- often digitally.
On the back of your program you will find one of David's original digital prints.</p>
<p>At this age he also began listening to more rap and hip-hop.
This encouraged him to explore lyrics and poetry for himself, though he was perhaps more private about this aspect of his life than any other.
Few of us in this room have heard David perform his poetry.
Those of you who have already know how fortunate you are.</p>
<p>[ TODO: if Alvena finds a poem(s), one could go here. ]</p>
<p>Toward the end of his highschool career, David fell in love with two sports: wrestling and football.
Wrestling attracted him directly -- but football required encouragement.
Gene Scott, who would become his coach, brought him to football with the words: &quot;You. I want YOU on the football team.&quot;
The strength, success, and friendships he found in sports brought balance to his highschool career.</p>
<p>When his cousins attended university in Regina, David  selflessly introduced them to the many friends he made at Robert Usher high school.
David was always generous with his time, money, and friendships in a way that many of us struggle to achieve.</p>
<p>Over the following years, David acquired many skills and friends in the trades.
He apprenticed in welding at Advanced Engineering.
He learned masonry and carpentry -- and found jobs in both.
Most recently, he achieved his full certification in roofing.
David found deep satisfaction in the completion of a job.
It was often the most difficult jobs that he took the most pride in.
His Facebook feed is peppered with photos of his broad smile at each job site.</p>
<p>David was well-known, and well-liked.
When David had money, he would share it with you.
When David had time, he would spend it with you.
Under the hardest circumstances, if all David had was his smile and his laugh, he would give you that.
This was the tenacity of David's generosity.
We can remember David's generosity throughout our own lives.
And, in that memory, we can strive to see and treat others in the same way.</p>
